Projects from Meta Front-End Developer course on Coursera

### 1. Retail webpage for a fictional garden design firm, *Lucky Shrub*

    ##### Requirements: 

    1. Header should contain the client logo.
    2. Main content should be a large promotional banner with three columns with text and images below it.
    3. Footer will have two columns: the first column should have a small logo and the second one should have copywriting information. 

    A short info paragraph and 3 logo images were provided. I created a html file using the requirements as a guide, and then customize the page using the client persona.
